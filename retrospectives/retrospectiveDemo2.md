# RETROSPECTIVE (Team 12)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following sections:

- [Process Measures](#process-measures)
- [Quality Measures](#quality-measures)
- [General Assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro Statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 5 out of 6
- Total points committed vs. done: 17 out of 25
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 110 hours 30 minutes out of 112 hours

**Remember**, a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)

### Detailed Statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|-------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| #0    | 6       | -      | 2 days 2 hours | 5 days 1 hour 45 minutes |
| #4    | 3       | 3      | 2 days       | 2 days 5 hours |
| #5    | 3       | 3      | 1 day 2 hours | 2 days 4 hours 45 minutes |
| #6    | 3       | 3      | 1 day 4 hours | 1 day 30 minutes |
| #7    | 3       | 3      | 1 day 4 hours | 2 hours |
| #8    | 3       | 5      | 1 day 4 hours | 1 day 7 hours 45 minutes |

> Place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 = -0.99

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
    - Total hours estimated
    - Total hours spent
    - Nr of automated unit test cases
    - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
    - Total hours estimated
    - Total hours spent
- Code review
    - Total hours estimated
    - Total hours spent

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
    1. Some tasks demanded more time, especially implementing Authentication.
    2. Coordination problems while fixing last incomplete work.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
    - Positive:
        - Improved group work management with sub-teams.
        - Effective communication enhanced collaboration.
        - Adaptability to changing requirements led to successful outcomes.
    - Negative:
        - Missed the goal of a true working demo before the deadline.
        - Inadequate workload division among team members.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
    - To split the work into multiple parallel flows for simultaneous work.

- Which ones were you not able to achieve? Why?
    - Failed to conduct a mid-sprint demo due to coordination issues between frontend and backend.
    - Test coverage improvement to at least 80% was not achieved.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
    - Pay attention to others' stories to support crucial tasks.
    - Complete tests on the not-covered code.
    - Schedule dedicated code review sessions to enhance code quality and reduce review time.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
    - Increased the number of finished stories compared to the last sprint.
