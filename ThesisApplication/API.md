## Insert Proposal
**POST `/API/thesis/proposals/{professorId}`**
- path variable `professorId`: the id of the professor inserting the proposal
- request body example:
    ```
    {
        "title" : "Advanced algorithms for image processing",
        "coSupervisors": [ "Paolo Ricci", "Mario Rossi" ],
        "keywords" : ["image processing"],

        "notes": "Collaboration with company equipe. Reimbursement of expenses"
        "expiration": "2024-04-23"
        "level" : "MSc"
        "CdS": ["ENG1", "ENG3"]
    }
    ```
    request body notes & constraints:
    - `coSupervisors`, `requiredKnowledge`, `notes` are *optional*
    - `expiration` is a date in the form `YYYY-MM-DD`
    - the **supervisor** is retrieved by path variable and the authenticated user

- response status:
  - `201 Created`: The proposal has been inserted in the DB
  - `400 Bad Request`: Error in the request body
  - `401 Unauthorized`: The user is not logged in
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: Generic server error

## Apply to Proposal
**POST `/API/thesis/proposals/apply`**
- request body example:
    ```
    {
        "studentId" : "s654140",
        "proposalId": "000003e8-8169-21ee-ae00-325096b39f47",

## Accept an application
**PATCH `/API/thesis/applications`**

Changes the application status to `accepted` or `declined`.
When an application is accepted, it automatically declines all the applications made by the same student to other proposals and 
by other students to the same proposal, and archives the proposal.

Example:
> There are 3 applications in the db:
> 
> (id:1, student:A, proposal:p1)
> 
> (id:2, student:B, proposal:p1)
> 
> (id:3, student:A, proposal:p3)
> 
> If application 1 is accepted, then application 2 (made by another student to the same proposal p1)
> and application 3 (made by the same student A) are declined. Furthermore, proposal p1 is archived

- request body example:
    ```
    {
        "id" : "f92b3e16-5291-44eb-ab6b-29d0ab97df9b",
        "status": "accepted",
    }
    ```

- response status:
  - `200 Ok`: The application status has been changed
